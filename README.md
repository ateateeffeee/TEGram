## Description of TEGRAM application

Like, share, comment this has become a norm in our modern world. In our final project to becoming Software Developers we at EOTECH took on the task of creating an Instagram clone application.

This app is asthetically pleasing from beginning to end. When you start on the landing page you'll find a gallery of photos that give you a preview of what's to come. You'll be asked to create an account, then sign in to be able to access the member only fun. 

Upon entering the application you'll find a feed of photos posted by all users. You may want to spend your time here or you may want to search for a specific user. On the navigation bar, find the search feature. Type part or all of the desired user's username in the search box. Then easily navigate to their profile with the click of a button. 

Not looking for anyone specific, but ready to set your profile up for success? Head back to the navigation bar and click on your username to get to your profile. Here you'll find your uploaded photos. Don't have any? Don't worry, click on the upload icon at the top of the page or if you just want to add a profile picture click on the edit profile text. Find a link of your favorite photos from your Google drive or straight off the internet, as long as there is a link and add them to your profile for the world to see.

To navigate back to your home feed of pictures just click on the TEGRAM logo. Spend hours showing off your favorite memories and liking, commenting or adding photos from your feed to your favorites list.
